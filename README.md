Teamed up with a group of three individuals to construct a clothing boutique. Developed a comprehensive application that incorporated Flask, a web framework, for the backend, while employing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. In addition, leveraged SQLite database and SQLAlchemy library to effectively manage and store the clothing store's data. All these elements were seamlessly interconnected through the utilization of Python.
