Teamed up with a group of three individuals to construct a clothing boutique. Developed a comprehensive application that incorporated Flask, a web framework, for the backend, while employing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. In addition, leveraged SQLite database and SQLAlchemy library to effectively manage and store the clothing store's data. All these elements were seamlessly interconnected through the utilization of Python.

Functionalities:
There are two types of users.

An **Owner** will be able to:
* sign in
* add items to the home page
* edit item information
* delete items from the home page
* log out

A **Customer** will be able to :
* sign in
* add items to their order
* view their order
* remove items from their order
* submit an order
* edit their billing information
* log out

If a user visits the website and are not signed in as either an Owner or Customer, they will only be able to view the items, sign up for an account, or log into an existing account.
