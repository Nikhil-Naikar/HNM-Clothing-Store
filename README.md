Teamed up with a group of three individuals to construct a clothing boutique. Developed a comprehensive application that incorporated Flask, a web framework, for the backend, while employing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. In addition, leveraged SQLite database and SQLAlchemy library to effectively manage and store the clothing store's data. All these elements were seamlessly interconnected through the utilization of Python.

Functionalities:
There are two types of users.

An Owner is responsible for maintaining the content of the website and will be able to:
sign in
add items to the home page
edit item information
delete items from the home page
log out

A Customer will be able to 
sign in
add items to their order
view their order
remove items from their order
submit an order
edit their billing information
log out

If a user visits the website and are not signed in as either an Owner or Customer, they will only be able to view the items, sign up for an account, or log into an existing account.
